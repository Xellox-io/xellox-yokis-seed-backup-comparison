![Xellox Yokis Kit â€“ Ultimate Seed-Phrase Storage](xellox-yokis-kit-seed-backup-engraver.png)

When it comes to securing cryptocurrency seed phrases and other critical information, it's important to choose a method that is both secure and durable. Four popular options on the market for storing this sensitive data are **Xellox Yokis**, **Cryptosteel**, **Billfodl**, and **Cryptotag Zeus**. Each of these solutions employs a different method to ensure the safety of your information, while all remain **compatible with BIP39-based wallets**, including Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard, and Sparrow.

## Xellox Yokis

Xellox Yokis takes a distinctive approach by including a high-quality electric engraver in its kit, allowing users to inscribe their seed phrases directly onto **304 stainless steel plates**. This method offers unmatched flexibility, enabling precise, personalized entriesâ€”just like writing on paper. Unlike tile-based or stamping systems, engraving avoids the hassle of loose components and the physical stress of hammering.

The engraved plates are **fire-resistant up to 1,450â€¯Â°C (2,642â€¯Â°F)** and have been **tested to withstand 9mm bullets**, offering an exceptional level of physical protection. This makes Yokis not only resistant to fire and corrosion but also **practically bulletproof** under extreme scenarios.

> Compatible with all BIP39-based wallets, including Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard, Sparrow and more.

## Cryptosteel

Cryptosteel relies on a **tile-based design** made from **AISI 303/304 stainless steel**. Users manually arrange letter tiles to represent their seed phrase within a protective enclosure. This method is entirely offline, immune to hacking, and **fire-resistant up to 1,400â€¯Â°C (2,552â€¯Â°F)**. Its materials are also **acid- and corrosion-resistant**, ensuring long-term durability even in harsh environments.

> Compatible with all BIP39-based wallets, including Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard, Sparrow and more.

## Billfodl

Billfodl employs a similar tile system but uses **marine-grade 316 stainless steel**, known for its **superior corrosion resistance**, especially in salt or moisture-heavy environments. Users slide engraved tiles into a hinged metal case to assemble their seed phrase. Itâ€™s been tested to **withstand temperatures exceeding 1,200â€¯Â°C (2,192â€¯Â°F)**, making it highly fire-resistant and durable.

> Compatible with all BIP39-based wallets, including Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard, Sparrow and more.

## Cryptotag Zeus

Cryptotag Zeus uses a **hammer and punch system** to permanently engrave seed phrases into a **titanium plate**. Users manually stamp each character using a hardened punch tool. The **aerospace-grade titanium** used provides **exceptional fire resistance up to 1,667â€¯Â°C (3,032â€¯Â°F)** and outstanding corrosion resistance. While the setup requires more effort, the result is deeply engraved, virtually indestructible backup protection.
